# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Repository for the AIR project concerning a sentiment analysis using twitter's API.

My first idea was to get tweets from a topic search or from a user and apply the sentiment analysis using both TextBlob and Vader, which is supposed to perform better on social media. We could then compare the two and find out just how much more effective Vader really is.
